###VI Description:
Resets the device to a known state. This VI disables power generation, resets session properties to their default values, commits the session properties, and leaves the sessions in the Uncommitted state. You can use this VI to clear certain errors in less time than using niDCPower Reset Device VI. Refer to the Programming States topic in the NI DC Power Supplies and SMUs Help for more information about NI-DCPower software states.
