###VI Description:
Applies the correction for propagation delay offsets to a digital pattern instrument. Use this VI to apply TDR offsets that are stored from a past measurement or are measured by means other than the niDigital TDR VI. Also use this VI to apply correction for offsets if the <B>apply offsets</B> input of the niDigital TDR VI was set to False at the time of measurement.
